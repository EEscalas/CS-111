# CS111
  Computer Science 111 is a course on Operating Systems at UCLA taught by Mark Kampe.
  Project High-Level Descriptions:
   
    
    Project 0:
      
      Preliminary practice using getoptlong() to parse command line options.
      Also an introduction to signal handling.
    
    
    Project 1:
      
      Establishing a client-server connection using pipes. The client sends commands inputted by the user to the server. The server polls
      for input from the pipe and then forks to have a child process execute the bash command. The bash command is then sent back to the
      client to display on the client's screen. Part b of this project includes encryption of the commands, which is highlighted in the
      log option that logs the encrypted messages sent between the client and the server.
    
    
    Project 2:
      
      Analyzing locking mechanisms by graphing the change in speed of a parallelized hash table.
    
    
    Project 3:
      
      Manually traversing through a Linux file system bit-by-bit to check for inconsistencies between metadata and data on disk.
